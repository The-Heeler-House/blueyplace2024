### Important notice!
This repository is being used to develop additional features for the overlay assuming that r/place will return in June 2024. r/place on AFD is essentially confirmed to not be happening, so this repository as-is currently is not functional.

# /r/place 2024 collaborative minimap userscript
Help [/r/MyLittlePony](https://reddit.com/r/mylittlepony) get a pony on /r/place!

### I want to help place pixels!

You can install the userscript to help! You just need a browser (Chrome or Edge preferred), a Tampermonkey-like extension, and a Reddit account. [Instructions below](README.md#userscript-instructions).

### I'm an ally and want to add, change or get art!

* r/place Bronies: We offer an osu!/Endu-style template containing our art, and can accept art either from osu!/Endu templates or as 1:1 images with coordinates. [Integration documentation](templates/mlp/integration.md)

## Userscript instructions

* Install Tampermonkey (https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
