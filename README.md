Help [r/Bluey](https://reddit.com/r/bluey) and [The Heeler House](https://discord.com/blueyheeler) leave a mark on [r/Place 2024](https://reddit.com/r/place)!

This repository contains the source code for the official Blueyplace Minimap, placer analytics, and art templates.

## I want to help place pixels!

You can install our official faction minimap to help! You just need a browser (Chrome or Edge preferred), a Tampermonkey-like extension, and a Reddit account. [Instructions below](README.md#userscript-instructions).

## I'm from another faction and want to initiate diplomacy!

* r/place Bronies: [Diplomatic contacts](templates/mlp/integration.md#diplomatic-contacts)

## I'm an ally and want to add, change, or get art to our minimap!

* r/place Bronies: We offer an osu!/Endu-style template containing our art, and can accept art either from osu!/Endu templates or as 1:1 images with coordinates. [Integration documentation](templates/mlp/integration.md)

## Minimap instructions

* Install Tampermonkey (https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
  * Android folks can use Kiwi Browser + Tampermonkey.
* Open the following page in your browser: <https://ponyplace-cdn.equestria.horse/ponyplace/loader.user.js>
  * This will invite you to install the userscript.
* Visit /r/place and click on the canvas to get it to load.
* Cycle to your template, if necessary, by clicking on the "Template: ..." setting.
